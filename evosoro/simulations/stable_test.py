In this example we evolve running soft robots in a terrestrial environment using a standard version of the physics
engine (_voxcad). After running this program for some time, you can start having a look at some of the evolved
morphologies and behaviors by opening up some of the generated .vxa (e.g. those in
evosoro/evosoro/basic_data/bestSoFar/fitOnly) with ./evosoro/evosoro/_voxcad/release/VoxCad
(then selecting the desired .vxa file from "File -> Import -> Simulation")

The phenotype is here based on a discrete, predefined palette of materials, which are visualized with different colors
when robots are simulated in the GUI.

Materials are identified through a material ID:
0: empty voxel, 1: passiveSoft (light blue), 2: passiveHard (blue), 3: active+ (red), 4:active- (green)

Active+ and Active- voxels are in counter-phase.
